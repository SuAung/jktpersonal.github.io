        <h3>Electricity from Photovoltaic Solar Collectors</h3>

            <a href="http://www.seia.org/policy/distributed-solar/net-metering" target="_blank">Net-metering</a> allows
            customers to sell locally
            generated electric power to the utility at retail price. This makes
            photovoltaic solar collectors cost-competitive in sunny regions
            where there is <a href="index.html">no shading from
                nearby trees or structures</a>.

        <h3>Support for Electric Utilities</h3>
        <p>
            Since times of maximum sunshine roughly correspond to times of
            maximum electrical demand and power costs more at those times,
            PV solar power is worth more than average electrical power. For
            how progressive utilities like San Diego Gas and Electric benefit,
            see <a href="http://www.energybiz.com" target="_blank">EnergyBiz
                article</a>. Power transistors that make
            conversions between DC and AC power can also provide power
            conditioning <a href="services.html">services</a> to regional
            utilities.

        <h3>Cogeneration</h3>
        <p>
            The hot exhaust and other heat from the engine driving an electric
            generator can be used for thermal processes and to heat buildings.
            This is called <em>combined heat and power</em> (CHP) or
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogeneration" target="_blank">
                cogeneration</a>. Heat generated by this means in industrial East
            Lawrence could be distributed in insulated underground pipes to
            adjacent residences and the central downtown area in what is called
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_heating" target="_blank"> district heating</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of the natural gas for CHP plants might be excess methane from
            <a href="http://www.energy.ca.gov/biomass/anaerobic.html" target="_blank"> anaerobic digestion</a> at the
            city's sewage treatment
            plant on the east side of East Lawrence. Electricity generated by
            CHP at all times of year would help power
            <a href="microgridPossibilities.html#examples">East Lawrence
                industry and residences</a>. Also, downtown restaurants might
            generate some of their electricity with CHP.
